# Opensox AI - Cursor Rules

## Code Style

### Comments
- always use lowercase when writing comments
- avoid unnecessary comments; code should be self-documenting when possible
- use comments to explain "why", not "what"


## Monorepo Structure
- this is a turborepo monorepo
- shared packages live in `packages/`
- apps live in `apps/` (web, api, backend, docs)
- respect package boundaries
- use workspace dependencies properly
